## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
reticulate::install_python(version = '3.13')
```

```{python}
import otter
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
KFF2019_original = pd.read_csv('data/KFF_2019.csv', skiprows = [1])
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{python}
KFF2019 = KFF2019_original[["Location","Uninsured"]]
KFF2019.shape
```

```{python}
KFF2019.head()
```

```{python}
USCDI_original = pd.read_csv('data/U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators.csv')
USCDI = USCDI_original[["YearStart","YearEnd","LocationDesc",
                        "Topic","Question","DataValueType", "DataValue",
                        "StratificationCategory1", "Stratification1"]]
USCDI
```
